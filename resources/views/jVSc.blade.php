<tbody>
<tr>
<td>C was developed by Dennis M. Ritchie between 1969 and 1973.</td>
<td>Java was developed by James Gosling in 1995.  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C is a Procedural Programming Language.</td>
<td>Java is Object-Oriented language.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C is more procedure-oriented.</td>
<td>Java is more data-oriented.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C is a middle-level language because binding of the gaps takes place between machine level language and high-level languages.</td>
<td>Java is a high-level language because translation of code takes place into machine language using compiler or interpreter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C is a compiled language that is it converts the code into machine language so that it could be understood by the machine or system.</td>
<td>Java is an Interpreted language that is in Java, the code is first transformed into bytecode and that bytecode is then executed by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C generally breaks down to functions.</td>
<td>Java breaks down to Objects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C programming language can be used for system programming as well as Application programming.</td>
<td>This is not the case in Java.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C does not contain the property called Inheritance because it does not support OOPS, which is very useful for code reusability. Thus C is not suited when one has to relate the things according to the real world.</td>
<td>Java contains the property of Inheritance which is very useful in code reuseability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Memory allocation can be done by malloc in C</td>
<td>Memory allocation can be done by a new keyword in Java.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> C is a low-level language. It has difficult interpretation for the user but it has a closer significance to the machine-level code.</td>
<td>Java is a high-level language because translation of code takes place into machine language using compiler or interpreter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In C declaration of variables is at the beginning of the block.</td>
<td>We can declare variables anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>free is used for freeing the memory in C.</td>
<td>A compiler will free up the memory internally by calling the garbage collector.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C does not supports Threading.</td>
<td>Java supports the concept of threading.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C supports pointers.</td>
<td>Java does not supports pointers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It is not portable.</td>
<td>It is portable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Call by value and call by reference is supported in C.</td>
<td>It only supports a call by value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C is platform dependent.</td>
<td>Java is a platform independent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It supports user-based memory management.</td>
<td>It internally manages the memory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C is not robust that is strict type checking does not takes place while compile and run time.</td>
<td>Java is robust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Exception handling cannot be directly achieved in C and thus it lacks the maintenance of normal flow of the program.</td>
<td>Exception Handling is supported in Java.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It follows a top-down approach.</td>
<td>Java follows a bottom-up approach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Overloading functionality is not supported by C.</td>
<td>Java supports method overloading which helps in code readability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C supports Preprocessors.</td>
<td>Java does not support Preprocessors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C does not supports OOPS concept.</td>
<td>Java supports OOPS concept.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Overloading functionality is not supported by C.</td>
<td>Java supports method overloading which helps in code readability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C supports the storage classes.</td>
<td>Whereas Java does not suport the storage classes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It has 32 keywords.</td>
<td>It has 50 keywords.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Go-to statements are supported in C language.</td>
<td>Java does not supports go-to statements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Virtual keywords are supported by C.</td>
<td>Virtual keywords are not supported by Java.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Overloading functionality is not supported by C.</td>
<td>Java supports method overloading which helps in code readability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Default members of C are public.</td>
<td>Default members of Java are private.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Data hiding is done by using static in C.</td>
<td>Data hiding is done by using private in Java.</td>
